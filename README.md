# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview
Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as good loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this project, a credit card dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, was used to make various models by applying Machine Learning.  
The following methods were applied:
1) Oversamplying using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms
2) Undersamplying using the ClusterCentroids algorithm
3) Combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm
4) Two machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk
